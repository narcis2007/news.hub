Everyone can send articles and everyone can register.
Users who are in a certain group (editors) can edit the articles received and send them further to the one who decides to publish them(the superuser admin in this case).
If the admin is not satisfied with the quality of the article he can check a box for that article to be edited again and can add some suggestions.
The admin can publish the article by checking a box in the administration pannel or uncheck the "to be edited" box to stop the article from being edited.
