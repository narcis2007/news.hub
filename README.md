Everyone can send articles and everyone can register.
Users who are in a certain group (editors) can edit the articles received and send them further to the publisher(the superuser admin in this case).
If the publisher(the superuser) is not satisfied with the quality of the article he can check a box for that article to be edited and can add some suggestions.
The publisher can publish the article by checking a box in the administration pannel or uncheck the "to be edited" box to stop the article from being edited.
